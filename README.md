# Chicago Data Analysis
## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`Chicago_Data_Analysis.ipynb`) that documents a data analysis project focused on exploring datasets related to the city of Chicago. The analysis utilizes Python with the Pandas library for data manipulation and SQL (specifically SQLite) for querying and extracting insights from the data.

The project investigates various aspects of Chicago data, including:

* Crime statistics
* Census information (e.g., community area demographics, hardship index)
* Public school data (e.g., safety scores)

The goal of this project was to review and answer specific questions related to these datasets using a combination of Python and SQL.
